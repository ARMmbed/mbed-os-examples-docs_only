# SlicingBlockDevice example

This example shows how to use `SlicingBlockDevice` to partition a HeapBlockDevice into three subunits. It showcases programming and reading back data segments, through both the underlying master block device and sliced subunits. To see this example in context, please see its [published documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/slicingblockdevice.html).
