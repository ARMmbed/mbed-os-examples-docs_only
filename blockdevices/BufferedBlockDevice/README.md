## BufferedBlockDevice Example

This BufferedBlockDevice example takes a [HeapBlockDevice](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/apis/bufferedblockdevice.html), whose read size is 256 bytes and program size is 512 bytes, and shows how you can read or program this block device with much smaller read/program sizes, using BufferedBlockDevice.

To see this example in context, please see its [published documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/bufferedblockdevice.html).
