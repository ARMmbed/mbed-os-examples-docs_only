# UDPSocket example
 
This example reads the current UTC time by sending UDP packet to "time.nist.gov" address at port 37.
 
**Note:** The current example is limited to the ethernet interface on supported 
devices. To use the example with a different interface, you will need to modify 
main.cpp and replace the EthernetInterface class with the appropriate interface.
