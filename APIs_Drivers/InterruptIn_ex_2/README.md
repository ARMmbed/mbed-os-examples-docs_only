# InterruptIn example

This example shows how to use InterruptIn to trigger function call when a certain event happens. The example demonstrates calling a function when a button is pressed. Specifically on the rising edge of a button press. This can be observed by LED4 blinking as the program runs and LED1 only changing when the button is pressed.
