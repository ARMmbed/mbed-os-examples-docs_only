QSPI driver usage example for mbed OS

This is a example showing how to use mbed-OS QSPI driver to access a device interfaced over Quad-SPI
The program does read/write operations on Flash memory connected over Quad-SPI interface using driver APIs in default QSPI mode.

QSPI can be configured into different modes, based on underlying interface support. Refer to QSPI flash block device for more information (https://github.com/ARMmbed/qspif-blockdevice)
