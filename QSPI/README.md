# QSPI driver usage example for Mbed OS

This example shows how to use the Mbed OS QuadSPI (QSPI) driver to access a device interfaced over QSPI. The program does read/write operations on Flash memory connected over the QSPI interface using driver APIs in default QSPI mode.

You can configure QSPI into different modes, based on underlying interface support. Refer to [QSPI flash block device](https://github.com/ARMmbed/qspif-blockdevice) for more information about this.

Note: For more context or to see this example in a rendered form, you can import into the Arm Mbed Online Compiler, please see [the documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/quadspi-qspi.html).
