## USBMouse absolute positioning example

The example emulates mouse over USB port.

1. Flash the board, and ensure the target's auxiliary USB is plugged into the PC.
2. Reset the target.
3. The mouse pointer should move on the screen making a cycle.

**Note:** With an absolute mouse, the USBMouse move function will move the mouse to coordinates x, y on the screen.
